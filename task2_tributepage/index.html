        <p>Sarah Janet Maas is an American fantasy author known for her fantasy series Throne of Glass and A Court of Thorns and Roses.<br><br>
           She was born on March 5, 1986, in New York City. She grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.As a child, she enjoyed creating stories based on popular tales or myths. She also used to write Sailor Moon fanfiction in her youth. In 2008, Maas graduated magna cum laude from Hamilton College in Clinton, Oneida County, New York, where she majored in creative writing and minored in religious studies.
           <br>In an interview with Writers & Artists, Maas told them that movie scores and classical music are her inspiration as a writer. She continued on to say that Sabriel written by Garth Nix and The Hero and the Crown by Robin McKinley began her love for reading fantasy and writing it. Her character development has been lauded as one of her best qualities for storytelling, with morally grey characters and strong world building.<br><br>A Court of Thorns and Roses, the second fantasy series by SJM, is a loose retelling of the traditional Beauty and the Beast. This book gave a whole new perspective for my life, it taught me the importance of choice. And along with that, it has so many beautiful characters who inspire you to do great, and always give your best!!
           She has an amazing world building quality. And all of her worlds are so unique and always has something more to offer.
           <br><br> She is one of my favourite author's, whose spirit and level of creativity just inspires me to create just as amazingly as she does.
